Workflow:
1. open one terminal for compilation in deepmimo/docs, and run: 
    - sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
2. open one terminal for serving in deepmimo/docs, and run:
    - `python -m http.server --directory _build/html` to serve the HTML in 127.0.0.1:8000 
    - `rmdir /s /q _build` on windows, to clear the build directory


To update the documentation (like adding an example), do this:

1. Push test package
2. Install test package on Colab
3. Add example to colab
4. Download notebook as manual_full.ipynb
5. Replace the table of contents in the downloaded notebook to be that of the manual.ipynb, because that one has markdown links.
6. Filter neededless stuff in manual.ipynb with: 
    `jupyter nbconvert manual_full.ipynb —ClearMetadataPreprocessor.enabled=True —clear-output —to notebook —output manual.ipynb`
7. Change docs/conf.py to exclude manual.ipynb
8. Change docs/index.md to include manual_full.ipynb
9. Compile.
10. Push manual.ipynb with the new example.


Alternatively:
1. Same until step 5 (including)
2. Push manual_full.ipynb to github

The only difference is the filtering step and having 2 files aboard.
